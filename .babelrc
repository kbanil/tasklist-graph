 * This is the Babel config file, .babelrc. Babel is the ES2015 transpiled used in
 * the book, and this is where we configure it. Luckily, its defaults are all really
 * good. However, we are wanting to increase the parser to use stage 1 specs, which are
 * nearly-there standards from ES7. This is mainly to allow us to use async/wait, which
 * is totally awesome and well worth it.
